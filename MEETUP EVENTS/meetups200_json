Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n <br />&nbsp;\n <br />On July 28 we will focus on a programming \"meta\" topic, a practice called Test Driven Development. TDD gives courage and leads to clean code and iterative design. In this workshop we will start with hands-on exercises of TDD, explain the benefits of this practice, and dive into some of the deeper challenges found in real life.&nbsp;\n <br />\n <br />While the techniques apply to nearly all programming languages, for this session we will use Objective-C and MacRuby to illustrate our points and tackle some of the challenges of applying TDD to Objective-C.

This hackathon combines open data with business! Open data will be supplied by the City of Amsterdam the business ideas come from the Sanoma app challenge. You can choose to make an app just with: <br />\n\n 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open data <br />\n\n 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Sanoma input <br />\n\n 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or you can combine these <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Different input means different prizes available!&nbsp; It is up to you to create THE multi-winning app! <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <strong>Wednesday 14 - 9 : Innovation</strong> <br />\n\n At 10.00 you will be briefed by the City of Amsterdam and Sanoma, giving you a heads-up in what (not) to create. Directly after this kick-off, teams will be created wherein discussion will flourish for ideas for the winning App. After the winning idea has emerged, you can start hacking! Strive towards perfection, make your idea #winning and earn those well deserved prizes! Need a break in between? Just visit one of those very interesting presentations on stage, which are totally free for hackathonners! <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <strong>Thursday 15th : Construction</strong> <br />\n\n Bring it on at a full day of hacking together! This is the day that you create the core of your app, the framework and all of the important bits (and bytes)! Some well deserved breaks can be taken whilst enjoying a nice key-note, or perform some creative exploring at the PICNIC terrain. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <strong>Friday 16th : Publication</strong> <br />\n\n In the morning hours you've got time for some last tweaks to your app, before you construct a mind-blowing presentation that is to be held to the jury in the afternoon. After each team presents their brainwaves and forthcoming marvelous apps, the jury will decide the winners and the prizes are rewarded! Hereafter, you are invited in the grand theater for the Vodafone Mobile Clicks awards. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <strong>Conditions</strong> <br />\n\n To participate in the hackathon you have to register at the Appsterdam meet up group. Become a member for free at <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam\">http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam</a> <br />\n\n <br />\n\n You have to bring your own laptop to Appsterdam at PICNIC to join the hackathon.&nbsp; You are allowed to bring your own food to the picnic but it is also possible to buy it in PICNIC village. You will get an PICNIC club badge which allows you to be at the PICNIC terrain, it is not a full access badge. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n <br />\n\n</p>\n\n",

A growing number of peripheral devices such as wireless weighs or pulse sensors help turning our personal phones into personal trainers. Yet one of the basic tenets of user engagement on those platforms remains: the notion of games. In the light of upcoming first&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gamesforhealtheurope.org/\">Games For Health Europe</a>, the talk will chart the different type of health games and gamification attempts, discuss the need for cooperation between developers and medical professionals, note the growing market of health applications for doctors and surgeons and try to answer whether \"serious games\" is an inherent contradiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.</p>\n<p>On October 15 we will give a hands-on Android session at the great Mediamatic location. It's meant for people who haven't learned Android, or haven't really \"flexed their muscles\" with it yet. We'll teach you in the way developers learn best: First we make sure you have the basic concepts at your fingertips, then we throw you in the deep end of the pool! That means you'll team up, pick an idea and start&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration : underline\">building</span>&nbsp;an app, learning with your team while being supported by the facilitators. And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.</p>\n<p>Hosts: Raul Portales of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thepilltree.com/web/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Pilltree</a>, Ronald van der Lingen of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.layar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Layar</a>, Matt Feigal</p>\n<p>Assistant Android Angels: Tony Atkins of Atlassian, Magnus Dahl</p>\n<p>Agenda:</p>\n<p>9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check</p>\n<p>10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Hands-on introduction to Android</p>\n<p>12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, \"Hackathon\" style guided learning with a team</p>\n<p>17:00 - Pizza and beer!</p>\n<p>This session is targeted at developers. No Android experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with Java (or at least not afraid of it). You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed and ready:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html\" target=\"_blank\">Java 7 SE JDK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Android SDK release 13</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html\" target=\"_blank\">ADT Plugin for Eclipse</a>. Whew! Here's a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html\" target=\"_blank\">pretty good guide</a>&nbsp;if you get lost.</p>\n<p>We ask a &euro;20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the&nbsp;<span>session</span>.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: Because we got two new assistants, we opened a few more spots to RSVP - you can find the \"bonus\" by <a href=\"http://www.mediamatic.net/page/230719/en\">RSVPing at the Mediamatic website</a>)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n",

As Mike wrote in his <a href=\"http://mur.mu.rs/?p=239\">blog</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left : 30px\">\"...it&rsquo;s important not just to get the nerds together, but also to get our families together. When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network....Getting to know each other&rsquo;s families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.</p>\n<p>This weekend, we are inviting you to our NDSM hangout and bring out your favorite board games, card games, iPad games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.</p>\n<p>Game Day will be at the Appsterdam Hangout at NDSM werf.</p>\n<p>From Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make an immediate right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right, walk past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see the Hangout is in a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left. If you get lost, please call Judy at +31 6 5043 7181.</p>\n<p>Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/2/4/event_63447172.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"></img></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/a/3/event_42029091.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; display : block ; margin : 5px\"></img></p>\n\n",

There is a very easy-to-use tool to structure your ideas and plot them on a so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\">Business Model Canvas</a>.</p>\n<p>Steven Zwerink (@szwerink) will facilitate a workshop where you will learn how to use this simple model for every new business idea. In an inspiring and creative session he will show you how you can use these models to create a business model for your ideas in less than fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>During this session you have the chance to create your own business model, share your new ideas with group of friendly Appsterdamrs and learn from Steven and each other. This way when the business model question comes you can answer it with confidence.

This weekend's launch party was specifically planned on the first Saturday in November&mdash;Museumnacht&mdash;the only night when Amsterdam's famed museums stay open, turning the city into one of the biggest multi-venue, multi-genre nerd parties in the world.</p>\n<p> <br />\n\n Our original plan was to have people pay for their own tickets. Then <a href=\"http://www.softlayer.com/marketplace\">SoftLayer</a> swooped in and picked up the tab, so we've got over 40 App Makers going to Museumnacht for free.\"</p>\n<p><strong>City Tours</strong></p>\n<p>Presented to you by Knowmads are two tours through Amsterdam that will make you fall in love with our city!</p>\n<p>Fortunately for you museum night is upon us and apart from the city there are a great many live performances, acts, music, expositions and events!</p>\n<p> <br />\n\nJoin the group and let yourself be overwhelmed with the beauty, atmosphere and history of Amsterdam on tour one, starting at 19:00 from NEMO, the Science Museum.</p>\n<p> <br />\n\nOR</p>\n<p>join group two to discover the amazing, dark sides of the city and yourself.Lunatics, ravers, pimps, criminals and alcoholics should be present at Central Station at 20.00.</p>\n<p> <br />\n\nFollow the group on Twitter to join us later in the evening: #Appdamn8 <br />\n\n <br />\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=230979150300338\">https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=230979150300338</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What is Museumnacht?</strong></p>\n<p>Every first Saturday of November, Amsterdam museums stay open from 7pm until 2am for the annual Museumnacht (\"Museum Night\"). Apart from seeing the permanent collections and temporary exhibitions, there is plenty more to see and do, also for non-Dutch visitors. On this 12th edition you can enjoy live music, DJ&rsquo;s, dance, performances, film, special tours, food &amp; drinks in the many museums of the city. For the Museumnacht you buy 1 ticket which gives you entry to 45 museums, free use of all GVB&nbsp;buses and trams, and 1 free museum visit valid until December 31. For more English info we advise you to visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/museumnacht\">Facebook page</a>. We hope to see you on the 5th of November! <a href=\"http://www.n8.nl/\">www.n8.nl</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/3/c/event_69789532.jpeg\" style=\"max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left\"></img></p>\n\n",

When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network....Getting to know each other&rsquo;s families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.</p>\n<p>Because our last game day was so much fun, this weekend for the second time, we are inviting you to bring out your favorite board games, card games, iPad games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.</p>\n<p>Game Day will be at the Appsterdam Hangout at NDSM werf.</p>\n<p>From Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make an immediate right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right, walk past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see the Hangout is in a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left.

This means that independent and small companies like yours are able to implement functionality like Mobile Payments, SMS, Location Based Services using the mobile network, etc</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most important goal of this meeting is to let the answers of the following questions become almost equal:</p>\n<p>-Which API's does the developer want/need?</p>\n<p>-Which API's can KPN provide?</p>\n<p>Workshop KPN likes to implement the API proposition as good as possible to your demands. Therefore, KPN asked SPING (known from Appsterdam Delft Hangout and recent Meet-the-Makers) to advise on the needs from the development community. In order to become acquainted with your technical, functional and business needs and requirements, Sping and creative partner Creatieve Koppen will organize <strong>2 creative sessions</strong>.</p>\n<p>During the creative sessions we will brainstorm and discuss the types of API&rsquo;s to be offered, possible combination of services, come up with new mobile concepts and business models.</p>\n<p>So, are you an App-developer or are you advising companies what apps could mean for their business? Do you see the potential of KPN API&rsquo;s and do you want to participate in this project? It&rsquo;s a unique chance to influence the choices that are made, get in touch with KPN decisionmakers and a great opportunity to create new business and mobile concepts.</p>\n<p>You can meet up for one of the two sessions:</p>\n<p>-First session is November 23 from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.</p>\n<p>-Second one is December 2nd from 1:00pm - 6:00pm</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hope to see you there!</p>\n\n",

This means that independent and small companies like yours are able to implement functionality like Mobile Payments, SMS, Location Based Services using the mobile network, etc</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most important goal of this meeting is to let the answers of the following questions become almost equal:</p>\n<p>-Which API's does the developer want/need?</p>\n<p>-Which API's can KPN provide?</p>\n<p>Workshop KPN likes to implement the API proposition as good as possible to your demands. Therefore, KPN asked SPING (known from Appsterdam Delft Hangout and recent Meet-the-Makers) to advise on the needs from the development community. In order to become acquainted with your technical, functional and business needs and requirements, Sping and creative partner Creatieve Koppen will organize <strong>2 creative sessions</strong>.</p>\n<p>During the creative sessions we will brainstorm and discuss the types of API&rsquo;s to be offered, possible combination of services, come up with new mobile concepts and business models.</p>\n<p>So, are you an App-developer or are you advising companies what apps could mean for their business? Do you see the potential of KPN API&rsquo;s and do you want to participate in this project? It&rsquo;s a unique chance to influence the choices that are made, get in touch with KPN decisionmakers and a great opportunity to create new business and mobile concepts.</p>\n<p>You can meet up for one of the two sessions:</p>\n<p>-First session is November 23 from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.</p>\n<p>-Second one is December 2nd from 1:00pm - 6:00pm</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hope to see you there!</p>\n\n",

This Saturday December 3th, the StartupBus kick-off party will take place at Atlassian. If you're interested in meeting both 'buspreneurs' and an elite group of successful entrepreneurs, feel free to RSVP.</p>\n<p>Party starts at 7pm until 10pm.</p>\n<p>More info on the Startup Bus:</p>\n<p>Starting in Amsterdam and ending at Paris in time for the LeWeb conference, StartupBus Europe will be an entrepreneurial competition like no other. Part-hackathon, part-road trip, participants will have 3 days to conceive, build and launch a startup while traveling 100km an hour across the continent before pitching to a panel of top industry figures at LeWeb.</p>\n<p>Participants will have the opportunity to test their skills against Europe&rsquo;s best hackers (developers), hustlers (marketeers) and hipsters (designers) while competing for the title of European Champions. In addition to the community that is formed, participants will be exposed to leading tech operations in Europe.</p>\n\n",

The White Elephant Gift Exchange is a light-hearted gift-giving game. If you are unfamiliar with this game, take a look at the gameplay here: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant...</a> Please bring a wrapped item to contribute to the gift exchange. We encourage you to bring something from your home rather than having to shop for a new item.

When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make a sharp right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The sign for the Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right. Walk straight past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left.

Find out why familiar desktop conventions are weak replacements for manipulating content directly, and learn to craft touchscreen interfaces that effortlessly teach users new gesture vocabularies. The challenge: gestures are invisible, without the visual cues offered by buttons and menus. As your touchscreen app sheds buttons, how do people figure out how to use the thing?</p>\n<p>Learn to lead your audience by the hand (and fingers) with practical techniques that make invisible gestures obvious. Designer Josh Clark, author of \"Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps,\" mines a variety of surprising sources for interface inspiration and design patterns. Along the way, discover the subtle power of animation, why you should be playing lots more video games, and why a toddler is your best beta tester.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well.

Appsterdam and Waag provide all facilities, communication and infrastructure needed to host a high quality evening on a topic of your choice in one of the cities oldest and most beautiful buildings, the Waag on Nieuwmarkt.</p>\n<p>This month <strong>Gijs Molenaar</strong> will host the first Amsterdam Computer Vision Meetup (ACVM). Computer Vision is a fascinating and fast growing field. The last years there have been major improvements in computer speed and therefore the ability to process images and video.</p>\n<p>Also, a growing number of people are carying small supercomputers with integrated camera&rsquo;s around in their pocket.There is a lot of knowledge and curiosity in Amsterdam related to computer vision, both from a professional and an artistic perspective. But since this field is so cutting edge this knowledge is protected and locked away inside companies and universities. The recent popularity and success of social tech meetings around the world learns us that a lot can be gained by opening up, meeting and sharing experiences and knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>For who?</strong></p>\n<p>This event is the perfect opportunity for curious minds who want to find out more about computer vision and techniques. We also welcome professionals that want to meet fellow specialists and artists or entrepreneurs looking for inspiration. Lastly, it is an evening for employers and potential employees to meet.</p>\n<p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>\n<p>Gijs Molenaar (pythonic.nl) &ndash; Short Introduction</p>\n<p>Cees Snoek (euvt.eu) &ndash; Video search engines based on visual categories and events</p>\n<p>Jan-Mark Geusebroek (perceptech.eu) &ndash; Visual classification of banknotes for recirculation</p>\n<p>Matthijs van Henten (ischen.nl) &ndash; Video To Sound</p>\n<p>Mark de Greef (VicarVision.nl) &ndash; FaceReader</p>\n<p>Jan van Gemert&nbsp;(UvA) &ndash;&nbsp;Correlating photograpic style with object categorization</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doors Open at 19.30 / Program starts at 20.00</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://events.waag.org/opendata/open-space/\">About Appsterdam &amp; Waag Open Space</a></strong></p>\n<p>Both Waag and Appsterdam share a goal in putting Amsterdam on the map as the new tech capital of the Europe and the world. We strongly believe that providing open frameworks is an effective way to build and strengthen a community.</p>\n<p>Give people the means and they will make it into what they need it to be. Giving people the means to contribute to ecosystem of quality tech events is yet another way to engage people in the community.</p>\n<p>Hosting a quality event can prove to be a costly exercise. How do you get a venue? How to you promote your event? How do get a sponsor? What does it cost? By helping people to setup their first event and plugging them into our infrastructure we believe we will create new group of highly engaged contributors to our community. We get to know the people with ideas, get an idea of what kind of events the community is looking for. Help people to be successful by sharing our knowledge, experience and network and create the next community leaders.&nbsp;We all benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>You have an idea for the next event?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>submit your format to <a href=\"mailto:openspace@appsterdam.rs\">openspace@appsterdam.rs</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n On January 19, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the second of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Our guru for the session is Matthijs Collard of <a href=\"http://www.unitid.nl/\">UNITiD</a>, who will lead a deep-dive into UNITiD's prototyping tools and techniques for mobile Apps. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n This session is primarily targeted at Graphic and Web Designers who want to learn how to make their designs &ldquo;clickable&rdquo;, but Developers and Interaction Designers who want to learn tools for fast prototyping are also welcome. To get the most out of the session, you will need <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks.html\">Adobe Fireworks</a> (any version from CS3 up to 5.5.), it is possible to get &nbsp;a trial version from the Adobe website. You also need a FTP program, such as the FTP client in Dreamweaver or <a href=\"http://filezilla-project.org/download.php\">FileZilla</a>. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Agenda: <br />\n\n 12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch <br />\n\n 13:00 - Workshop starts <br />\n\n 17:00 - Beer, Wine, pizza and socializing until closing time <br />\n\n <br />\n\n We ask a &euro;20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available to Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces are available to BNO members (contact BNO if you are a member!)<strong> <br />\n\n</strong></p>\n\n",

Let's get cookin'!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.delaurier.nl/\">Kookstudio de Laurier</a>, the first cooking studio established in Amsterdam, has been catering and teaching people how to cook for 20 years. On January 21, Chef Kati will teach us Appsterdammers how to make pasta <em>from scratch</em>. Everyone will get involved in the whole process: prepping, making, cooking, and washing up. And the best part is&hellip; we get to eat what we make! In the end, Chef Kati will send us home with recipes for the dishes we prepared.</p>\n<p>Our cooking class will be combined with a very basic Dutch lesson, lead by our very own Robert Shepard. He'll teach us the Dutch words of the ingredients we'll use as well as some basic conversational phrases. Emphasis will be on pronunciation, so this will be a great way to figure out exactly how to say such words as <em>grachtengordel</em>, <em>Schipol</em>, and <em>buienradar</em>. Even if you already speak Dutch, you can still help us clueless people out ;)</p>\n<p>As with every Appsterdam Family Weekend, people of all ages are welcome to attend. The menu has been designed to be fun for kids and adults. Please bring your <strong>&euro;25 in cash</strong> to pay on the day of the event. Beverages (soda, beer, etc.) are not included in the price so bring cash for that too. And fortunately, wine is as inexpensive as &euro;15 per bottle. The normal fee for cooking class is &euro;52-65 per person, so Chef Kati is really giving us a great discount.</p>\n<p>See you all in the kitchen!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:</strong></p>\n<p>Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his <a href=\"http://mur.mu.rs/?p=239\">blog</a>: \"Getting to know each other&rsquo;s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you soon!</p>\n\n",

The platform is available for other developers to use within applications, allowing context awareness to be an integral part of their solutions.

Thus was born the northern German tradition of the <strong><em>Kohlfahrt</em></strong>, or \"cabbage quest.\" Join us as we brave Bremen's frozen forests, dragging wagons of booze. Along the way we will make frequent stops to lighten our load with drinking games, and lighten our mood with party games. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Upon arriving at the feasting hall, we will slake our thirst with soup and beer, and fill our bellies with sausage, potatoes, and lest we forget&#151;cabbage. The people who eat the most and dominate the games are crowned Cabbage King and Queen, and granted the solemn duty of organizing next year's kohlfahrt. Then we dance the night away like people who don't know how to dance, but aren't about to let that stop them from having a good time.</p>\n<p>Did we mention the booze wagon?

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n On March 14, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the third of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Our guru for the session is Ruben Bos of <a href=\"http://www.mangrove.nl/\">Mangrove</a>,&nbsp;who will lead a deep-dive into designing strong User Experience (UX) for mobile Apps. At Mangrove he worked on apps like Txxi, BOVAG and Ministry of Defense. In this session he will explain UX techniques and best practices, largely based on lessons learned from years of web development. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n This session is primarily targeted at Graphic and Web Designers to learn UX design for mobile, but Developers and Interaction Designers who want to improve their UX skills are also welcome. Be prepared to get your hands dirty as the workshop will be largely paper and marker based. A laptop or smartphone is not mandatory but advisable. <br />\n\n <br />\n\n Agenda: <br />\n\n 12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch <br />\n\n 13:00 - Workshop starts <br />\n\n 17:00 - Beer, Wine, pizza and socializing until closing time <br />\n\n <br />\n\n We ask a &euro;20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available to Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces are available to BNO members (contact BNO if you are a member!)<strong> <br />\n\n</strong></p>\n\n",
